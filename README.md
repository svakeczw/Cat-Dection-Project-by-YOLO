## Introduction
This reposity is to use YOLO and darknet framework to train a model for object detection.

## The story
My friend has a cat recently, and it is a Devon Rex. I learnt a CV algorithm, and it is YOLO. I feel exciting to see what will happen if i apply the YOLO to detect the Devon Rex. Firstly, I collected the picture data of Devon from google(about 150 pic) and manually labeled them. I used Darknet framork to train the model and let's see what I've done.
